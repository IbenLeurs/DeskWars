# DeskWars Prototype
Prototype for a game I created called DeskWars, made as my thesis in Game Development.
    
For my education in Game Development we had 4 months to created a game for our thesis.  
This covered all topics from programming to asset creation.  
The build you can download here is the final version I used to present my thesis with.
    
Since this has taken a lot of effort I decided to share it so people could enjoy it.
    
Once I agian I would like to mention that this is a prototype.
That means there is just a single level, lots of bugs, not all features work and no real way to win or lose the game.  
  
I hope you enjoy
